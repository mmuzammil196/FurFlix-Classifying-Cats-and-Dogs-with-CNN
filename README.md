This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a model for classifying images of cats and dogs with an impressive 80% accuracy. 

The model is trained on a large dataset of cat and dog images, enabling it to make predictions on new images with high precision. 

The notebook provides a detailed implementation of the CNN algorithm and showcases the visualizations of the dataset, enhancing the understanding of the classification process. 

It's an exciting project for all pet lovers! 🐾📷🔍
